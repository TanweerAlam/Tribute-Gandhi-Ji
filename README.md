# Tribute-Gandhi-Ji
This is a Tribute page to The Father of India Nation, the Gandhi Ji. This was my first HTML page assigned from freecodecamp as a project.

In the very beginning when the project was assigned, I had made a tribute page to Nelson Mandela itself. As it was shown in the freecodecamp, I designed the similar page so that I could determine and understand the flow of the boxes in HTML and the CSS properties.
Laterly, I changed the page to Tribute: Gandhi Ji.
